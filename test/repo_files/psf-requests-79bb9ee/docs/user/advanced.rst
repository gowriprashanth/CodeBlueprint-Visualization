Advanced Usage
==============

This document covers some of Requests more advanced features.


Session Objects
---------------

The Session object allows you to persist certain parameters across
requests. It also persists cookies across all requests made from the
Session instance.

A session object has all the methods of the main Requests API.

Let's persist some cookies across requests::

    s = requests.session()

    s.get('http://httpbin.org/cookies/set/sessioncookie/123456789')
    r = s.get("http://httpbin.org/cookies")

    print r.text
    # '{"cookies": {"sessioncookie": "123456789"}}'


Sessions can also be used to provide default data to the request methods::

    headers = {'x-test': 'true'}
    auth = ('user', 'pass')

    with requests.session(auth=auth, headers=headers) as c:

        # both 'x-test' and 'x-test2' are sent
        c.get('http://httpbin.org/headers', headers={'x-test2': 'true'})


Any dictionaries that you pass to a request method will be merged with the session-level values that are set. The method-level parameters override session parameters.

.. admonition:: Remove a Value From a Dict Parameter

    Sometimes you'll want to omit session-level keys from a dict parameter. To do this, you simply set that key's value to ``None`` in the method-level parameter. It will automatically be omitted.

All values that are contained within a session are directly available to you. See the :ref:`Session API Docs <sessionapi>` to learn more.

SSL Cert Verification
---------------------

Requests can verify SSL certificates for HTTPS requests, just like a web browser. To check a host's SSL certificate, you can use the ``verify`` argument::

    >>> requests.get('https://kennethreitz.com', verify=True)
    requests.exceptions.SSLError: hostname 'kennethreitz.com' doesn't match either of '*.herokuapp.com', 'herokuapp.com'

I don't have SSL setup on this domain, so it fails. Excellent. Github does though::

    >>> requests.get('https://github.com', verify=True)
    <Response [200]>

You can also pass ``verify`` the path to a CA_BUNDLE file for private certs. You can also set the ``REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`` environment variable.


Body Content Workflow
---------------------

By default, when you make a request, the body of the response isn't downloaded immediately. The response headers are downloaded when you make a request, but the content isn't downloaded until you access the :class:`Response.content` attribute.

Let's walk through it::

    tarball_url = 'https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/tarball/master'
    r = requests.get(tarball_url)

The request has been made, but the connection is still open. The response body has not been downloaded yet. ::

    r.content

The content has been downloaded and cached.

You can override this default behavior with the ``prefetch`` parameter::

    r = requests.get(tarball_url, prefetch=True)
    # Blocks until all of request body has been downloaded.


Configuring Requests
--------------------

Sometimes you may want to configure a request to customize its behavior. To do
this, you can pass in a ``config`` dictionary to a request or session. See the :ref:`Configuration API Docs <configurations>` to learn more.


Keep-Alive
----------

Excellent news — thanks to urllib3, keep-alive is 100% automatic within a session! Any requests that you make within a session will automatically reuse the appropriate connection!

Note that connections are only released back to the pool for reuse once all body data has been read; be sure to either set ``prefetch`` to ``True`` or read the ``content`` property of the ``Response`` object.

If you'd like to disable keep-alive, you can simply set the ``keep_alive`` configuration to ``False``::

    s = requests.session()
    s.config['keep_alive'] = False


Asynchronous Requests
----------------------

Requests has first-class support for concurrent requests, powered by gevent.
This allows you to send a bunch of HTTP requests at the same time.

First, let's import the async module. Heads up — if you don't have
`gevent <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gevent>`_ this will fail::

    from requests import async

The ``async`` module has the exact same api as ``requests``, except it
doesn't send the request immediately. Instead, it returns the ``Request``
object.

We can build a list of ``Request`` objects easily::

    urls = [
        'http://python-requests.org',
        'http://httpbin.org',
        'http://python-guide.org',
        'http://kennethreitz.com'
    ]

    rs = [async.get(u) for u in urls]

Now we have a list of ``Request`` objects, ready to be sent. We could send them
one at a time with ``Request.send()``, but that would take a while.  Instead,
we'll send them all at the same time with ``async.map()``.  Using ``async.map()``
will also guarantee execution of the ``response`` hook, described below. ::

    >>> async.map(rs)
    [<Response [200]>, <Response [200]>, <Response [200]>, <Response [200]>]

.. admonition:: Throttling

    The ``map`` function also takes a ``size`` parameter, that specifies the number of connections to make at a time::

        async.map(rs, size=5)


Event Hooks
-----------

Requests has a hook system that you can use to manipulate portions of
the request process, or signal event handling.

Available hooks:

``args``:
    A dictionary of the arguments being sent to Request().

``pre_request``:
    The Request object, directly before being sent.

``post_request``:
    The Request object, directly after being sent.

``response``:
    The response generated from a Request.


You can assign a hook function on a per-request basis by passing a
``{hook_name: callback_function}`` dictionary to the ``hooks`` request
parameter::

    hooks=dict(args=print_url)

That ``callback_function`` will receive a chunk of data as its first
argument.

::

    def print_url(args):
        print args['url']

If an error occurs while executing your callback, a warning is given.

If the callback function returns a value, it is assumed that it is to
replace the data that was passed in. If the function doesn't return
anything, nothing else is effected.

Let's print some request method arguments at runtime::

    >>> requests.get('http://httpbin.org', hooks=dict(args=print_url))
    http://httpbin.org
    <Response [200]>

Let's hijack some arguments this time with a new callback::

    def hack_headers(args):
        if args.get('headers') is None:
            args['headers'] = dict()

        args['headers'].update({'X-Testing': 'True'})

        return args

    hooks = dict(args=hack_headers)
    headers = dict(yo=dawg)

And give it a try::

    >>> requests.get('http://httpbin.org/headers', hooks=hooks, headers=headers)
    {
        "headers": {
            "Content-Length": "",
            "Accept-Encoding": "gzip",
            "Yo": "dawg",
            "X-Forwarded-For": "::ffff:24.127.96.129",
            "Connection": "close",
            "User-Agent": "python-requests.org",
            "Host": "httpbin.org",
            "X-Testing": "True",
            "X-Forwarded-Protocol": "",
            "Content-Type": ""
        }
    }


Custom Authentication
---------------------

Requests allows you to use specify your own authentication mechanism.

Any callable which is passed as the ``auth`` argument to a request method will
have the opportunity to modify the request before it is dispatched.

Authentication implementations are subclasses of ``requests.auth.AuthBase``,
and are easy to define. Requests provides two common authentication scheme
implementations in ``requests.auth``: ``HTTPBasicAuth`` and ``HTTPDigestAuth``.

Let's pretend that we have a web service that will only respond if the
``X-Pizza`` header is set to a password value. Unlikely, but just go with it.

::

    from requests.auth import AuthBase
    class PizzaAuth(AuthBase):
        """Attaches HTTP Pizza Authentication to the given Request object."""
        def __init__(self, username):
            # setup any auth-related data here
            self.username = username

        def __call__(self, r):
            # modify and return the request
            r.headers['X-Pizza'] = self.username
            return r

Then, we can make a request using our Pizza Auth::

    >>> requests.get('http://pizzabin.org/admin', auth=PizzaAuth('kenneth'))
    <Response [200]>


Streaming Requests
------------------

With ``requests.Response.iter_lines()`` you can easily iterate over streaming
APIs such as the `Twitter Streaming API <https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-api>`_.

To use the Twitter Streaming API to track the keyword "requests":

::

    import requests
    import json

    r = requests.post('https://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/filter.json',
        data={'track': 'requests'}, auth=('username', 'password'))

    for line in r.iter_lines():
	    if line: # filter out keep-alive new lines
		    print json.loads(line)


Verbose Logging
---------------

If you want to get a good look at what HTTP requests are being sent
by your application, you can turn on verbose logging.

To do so, just configure Requests with a stream to write to::

    >>> my_config = {'verbose': sys.stderr}
    >>> requests.get('http://httpbin.org/headers', config=my_config)
    2011-08-17T03:04:23.380175   GET   http://httpbin.org/headers
    <Response [200]>
