`ScraperWiki <https://scraperwiki.com/>`_ is an excellent service that allows
you to run Python, Ruby, and PHP scraper scripts on the web. Now, Requests
v0.6.1 is available to use in your scrapers!

To give it a try, simply::

    import requests


Managed Packages

the ideal way to install Requests is via The Cheeseshop.


Ubuntu & Debian
---------------

Requests is available installed as a Debian package! Debian Etch Ubuntu, since Oneiric::

    $ apt-get install python-requests

Unfortunately, the most recent version available is  v0.5.0. If you're on the
Debian Python Package team, I'd love an update of that :)

    $ yum install python-requests
