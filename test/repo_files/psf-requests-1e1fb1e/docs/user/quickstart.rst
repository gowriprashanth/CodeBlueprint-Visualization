Feature Overview
================

Requests is designed to solve a 90% use case â€” making simple requests. While most
HTTP libraries are extremely extensible, they often attempt to support the entire HTTP Spec.
This often leads to extremely messy and cumbersome APIs, as is the case with urllib2. Requests abandons support for edge-cases, and focuses on the essentials.
