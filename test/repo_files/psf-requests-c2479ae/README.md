Behold, the power of Requests:

``` {.sourceCode .python}
>>> import requests
>>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
>>> r.status_code
200
>>> r.headers['content-type']
'application/json; charset=utf8'
>>> r.encoding
'utf-8'
>>> r.text
u'{"type":"User"...'
>>> r.json()
{u'disk_usage': 368627, u'private_gists': 484, ...}
```

See [the similar code, sans Requests](https://gist.github.com/973705).

Requests allows you to send *organic, grass-fed* HTTP/1.1 requests,
without the need for manual labor. There's no need to manually add query
strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and
HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, thanks to
[urllib3](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3).

Besides, all the cool kids are doing it. Requests is one of the most
downloaded Python packages of all time, pulling about 60,000,000
downloads every month. You don't want to be left out!
