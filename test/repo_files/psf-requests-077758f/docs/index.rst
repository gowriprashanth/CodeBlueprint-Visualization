Requests: HTTP for Humans
=========================

Release v\ |version|. (:ref:`Installation <install>`)

Requests is an :ref:`ISC Licensed <isc>` HTTP library, written in Python, for human beings.

Most existing Python modules for sending HTTP requests are extremely verbose
and cumbersome. Python's builtin **urllib2** module provides most of
the HTTP capabilities you should need, but the api is thoroughly **broken**.
It requires an *enormous* amount of work (even method overrides) to perform
the simplest of tasks.

Things shouldnâ€™t be this way. Not in Python.

::

    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com', auth=('user', 'pass'))
    >>> r.status_code
    204
    >>> r.headers['content-type']
    'application/json'
    >>> r.content
    ...

See `the same code, without Requests <https://gist.github.com/973705>`_.

Requests allow you to send  **HEAD**, **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**,
**PATCH**, and **DELETE** HTTP requests. You can add headers, form data,
multipart files, and parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access the
response data in the same way. It's powered by :py:class:`urllib2`, but it does
all the hard work and crazy hacks for you.

**Armin Ronacher**
    Requests is the perfect example how beautiful an API can be with the
    right level of abstraction.

**Daniel Greenfeld**
    Nuked a 1200 LOC spaghetti code library with 10 lines of code thanks to
    @kennethreitz's request library. Today has been AWESOME.

**Kenny Meyers**
    Python HTTP: When in doubt, or when not in doubt, use Requests. Beautiful,
    simple, Pythonic.

**Rich Leland**
   Requests is awesome. That is all.
