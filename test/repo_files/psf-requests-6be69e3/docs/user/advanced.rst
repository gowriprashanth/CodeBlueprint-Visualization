Advanced Usage
==============

This document covers some of Requests more advanced features.


Session Objects
---------------

The Session object allows you to persist certain parameters across
requests. It also establishes a CookieJar and passes it along
to any requests made from the Session instance.

A session object has all the methods of the main Requests API.

Let's persist some cookies across requests::

    s = requests.session()

    s.get('http://httpbin.org/cookies/set/sessioncookie/123456789')
    r = s.get("http://httpbin.org/cookies")

    print r.content
    # '{"cookies": {"sessioncookie": "123456789"}}'


Sessions can also be used to provide default data to the request methods::

    headers = {'x-test': 'true'}
    auth = ('user', 'pass')

    with requests.session(auth=auth, headers=headers) as c:

        # both 'x-test' and 'x-test2' are sent
        c.get('http://httpbin.org/headers', headers={'x-test2': 'true'})


.. admonition:: Global Settings

    Certain parameters are best set at the ``request.config`` level
    (e.g.. a global proxy, user agent header).


Asynchronous Requests
----------------------

Requests has first-class support for non-blocking i/o requests, powered
by gevent. This allows you to send a bunch of HTTP requests at the same

First, let's import the async module. Heads up â€” if you don't have
`gevent <gevent>`_ this will fail::

    from requests import async

The ``async`` module has the exact same api as ``requests``, except it
doesn't send the request immediately. Instead, it returns the ``Request``
object.

We can build a list of ``Request`` objects easily::

    urls = [
        'http://python-requests.org',
        'http://httpbin.org',
        'http://python-guide.org',
        'http://kennethreitz.com'
    ]

    rs = [async.get(u) for u in urls]

Now we have a list of ``Request`` objects, ready to be sent. We could send them
one at a time with ``Request.send()``, but that would take a while.  Instead,
we'll send them all at the same time with ``async.map()``.  Using ``async.map()``
will also guarantee execution of the ``response`` hook, described below. ::

    >>> async.map(rs)
    [<Response [200]>, <Response [200]>, <Response [200]>, <Response [200]>]


Event Hooks
-----------

Requests has a hook system that you can use to manipulate portions of
the request process, or signal event handling.

Available hooks:

``args``:
    A dictionary of the arguments being sent to Request().

``pre_request``:
    The Request object, directly before being sent.

``post_request``:
    The Request object, directly after being sent.

``response``:
    The response generated from a Request.


You can assign a hook function on a per-request basis by passing a
``{hook_name: callback_function}`` dictionary to the ``hooks`` request
parameter::

    hooks=dict(args=print_url)

That ``callback_function`` will receive a chunk of data as its first
argument.

::

    def print_url(args):
        print args['url']

If an error occurs while executing your callback, a warning is given.

If the callback function returns a value, it is assumed that it is to
replace the data that was passed in. If the function doesn't return
anything, nothing else is effected.

Let's print some request method arguments at runtime::

    >>> requests.get('http://httpbin', hooks=dict(args=print_url))
    http://httpbin
    <Response [200]>

Let's hijack some arguments this time with a new callback::

    def hack_headers(args):
        if not args[headers]:
            args['headers'] = dict()

        args['headers'].update({'X-Testing': 'True'})

        return args

    hooks = dict(args=hack_headers)
    headers = dict(yo=dawg)

And give it a try::

    >>> requests.get('http://httpbin/headers', hooks=hooks, headers=headers)
    {
        "headers": {
            "Content-Length": "",
            "Accept-Encoding": "gzip",
            "Yo": "dawg",
            "X-Forwarded-For": "::ffff:24.127.96.129",
            "Connection": "close",
            "User-Agent": "python-requests.org",
            "Host": "httpbin.org",
            "X-Testing": "True",
            "X-Forwarded-Protocol": "",
            "Content-Type": ""
        }
    }



Verbose Logging
---------------

If you want to get a good look at what HTTP requests are being sent
by your application, you can turn on verbose logging.

To do so, just configure Requests with a stream to write to::

    >>> requests.settings.verbose = sys.stderr
    >>> requests.get('http://httpbin.org/headers')
    2011-08-17T03:04:23.380175   GET   http://httpbin.org/headers
    <Response [200]>
