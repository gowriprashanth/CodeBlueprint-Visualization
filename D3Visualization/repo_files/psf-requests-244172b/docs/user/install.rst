Installation
============

This part of the documentation covers the installation of Requests.
The first step to using any software package is getting it properly installed.


Distribute & Pip
----------------

Installing requests is simple with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::

    $ pip install requests

or, with `easy_install <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_::

    $ easy_install requests

But, you really `shouldn't do that <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html#pip-compared-to-easy-install>`_.



Cheeseshop Mirror
-----------------

If the Cheeseshop is down, you can also install Requests from Kenneth Reitz's
personal `Cheeseshop mirror <http://pip.kreitz.co/>`_::

    $ pip install -i http://pip.kreitz.co/simple requests


Get the Code
------------

Requests is actively developed on GitHub, where the code is
`always available <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`_.

You can either clone the public repository::

    git clone git://github.com/kennethreitz/requests.git

Download the `tarball <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/tarball/master>`_::

    $ curl -O https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/tarball/master

Or, download the `zipball <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/zipball/master>`_::

    $ curl -O https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/zipball/master


Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your Python package,
or install it into your site-packages easily::

    $ python setup.py install

.. _gevent:

Installing Gevent
-----------------

If you are using the ``requests.async`` module for making concurrent
requests, you need to install gevent.

To install gevent, you'll need ``libevent``.

OSX::

    $ brew install libevent

Ubuntu::

    $ apt-get install libevent-dev

Once you have ``libevent``, you can install ``gevent`` with ``pip``::

    $ pip install gevent
